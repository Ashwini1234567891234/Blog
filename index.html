      <p class="text-muted">This cafe is huge and the ambience is vibrant. The food was good and the service thoughtful and prompt. I guess the action that made my view about the experience so delightful is that one of my family members was fasting which the lady manager noticed and got him a platter of fruits. The gesture was much appreciated. And it was a great evening spent. Thank you Lotus Cafe.

        The monuments were very impressive indeed. The gardens around the monuments are very well-maintained as are the monuments themselves. However, there is no facility to hire guides or audio gear to help one to understand what each structure was used for. This is a good place to visit only if you are on a conducted tour with a guide.

            "The Lion King" has been one of my favorite Disney animated films, so I was nervous about seeing Jon Favreau's remake. Surprisingly, from beginning to end, I found myself consistently enjoying this remake more than the original, and I had no problem with it. This remake absorbed my attention with it's astounding, dazzling visuals, and this is the only Disney lifelike remake that has no humans, and animals are my passion. Jon Favreau and his crew pulled it off so well, and how on earth did they do it? Let me explain: When it comes to the craftsmanship, it is an incredible technical achievement; in beats, we all knew it has the same story, but as you are watching it, you are wondering how the filmmaking techniques will execute the same story differently, and I did not expect much at all. Jon Favreau displays his best direction here due to his effective and persistent timing and cadence. Not to mention that he has showcased the movie's heart that is in the perfect place, because of how well he handles the tone</p>
